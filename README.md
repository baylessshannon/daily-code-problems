# Daily Code Problems

This repo contians my solutions to different Daily Coding Problems. THese problems are sent out daily to email subscribers and are meant to share common technical interview questions asked by large tech companies.

For example, the first problem solved in this repo was asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number ```k```, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to ```k```.

For example, given ```[10, 15, 3, 7]``` and ```k``` of ```17```, return true since ```10 + 7 is 17```.

My solution to this problem is contained in [add-to-k.ipynb](https://github.com/baylessshannon/daily-code-problems/blob/master/add-to-k.ipynb)
