    "An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding ```next``` and ```prev``` fields, it holds a field named ```both```, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an ```add(element)``` which adds the element to the end, and a ```get(index)``` which returns the node at index.\n",

    "If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to ```get_pointer``` and ```dereference_pointer``` functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses."
